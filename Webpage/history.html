        Diabetes has existed in its various forms for thousands of years. 
        <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999615013089">Ancient Egyptian physician, Hesy-Ra is said to have described diabetes as early as 3000 BC</a>
        with a more detailed account of the condition coming from a medical document known as 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_Papyrus">the Ebers Papyrus</a> 
        which dates back to approximately 1550 BC. 
        Although some have pointed to the described affliction on the centuries old papyrus as unsatisfactory, 
        it describes a 'need to eliminate urine which is too plentiful'. 
        Unfortunately though <a href="https://images.journals.lww.com/theendocrinologist/PdfPageImage.00019616-200603000-00001.0.jpeg">one of the words crucial in the description</a>
        can mean both plentiful or frequent.
        Polyuria (increased volume of urine) is now a well known symptom of diabetes, while increased frequency of micturtion is symptomatic of the more common cystitis leading scholars to believe it the condition the document references.

        Come 5th century B.C. Indian physicians would call it 'madhumeha' or 'honey urine' refering to how the urine of those afflicted would take on a sweet taste and attract ants or flies. 
        One of these physicians, Susruta would even go on to describe what we now refer to as Type I and II diabetes.
        Saying that it was either a
        <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00925.2007"> disease of the urinary tract brought on by poor genetics or diet, or an incurable condition.</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="txtDramatic1">“… no essential part of the drink is absorbed by the body while great masses of the flesh are liquefied into urine.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Aretaeus of Cappadocia the celebrated Greek physician would dramatically describe what we now call diabetic ketoacidocis some time in the first century A.D.
        For the uninitiated, diabetic ketoacidocis or <span class="txtRed">DKA</span> is ultimately what will kill an untreated Type I diabetic. It is a condition whereby the body
        cannibalizes fat and muscle to produce a dietary acid called ketones for energy. These ketones build up in your blood and are excreted through your urine.
        The buildup of ketones unbalances the PH of your blood, acidifying it and ultimately leading to multiple organ failure and death.

        In 1869 a German pathologist named Paul Langerhans would identify the cells that secrete insulin, now islets of Langerhans. Though insulin itself would not be named until the early 1900's.
        <p>in 1889 Jospeh von Mering and Oskar Minkowski would in their experiments discover that the removal of ones pancreas would produce severe, fatal diabetes. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1921 Frederick Banting, Charles Best and James Collip, working under the supervision of John Macleod at the University of Toronto would perform an experiment where the exocrine pancreas
        was atrophied, but the endocrine pancreas was left intact. It was discovered that these duct-ligated dogs did not develop diabetes. The pancreatic secretions of the remaining islets of Langerhans
        would be extracted and isolated. Dogs suffering from glycosuria would be injected with this isolate. The very first insulin therapy treatment, albiet crude.
        </p>
         <p>However, less than one year later on May 3rd 1922 it would be announced to the world that the antidiabetic agent <span class="txtDramatic2">Insulin</span> had been discovered. 
        </p>
        <p>
        On the 15th of October 1923 Eli Lilly -- a medical company founded in Indianapolis Indiana -- would begin shipping the worlds first commercial supply of insulin.
        and in November of that year, Nordisk -- a not-for-profit laboratory would begin producing insulin outside of North America helping bring insulin to a global audience.
